                    <p>I have a lot of different ideas that I am currently working on, but am most interested in game design, especially games in the vein of Undertale that deal with deep emotional and philosophical concepts while remaining fun to play. Ultimately, I have the dream of working on Christian video games that might do the same, although I am a long way from doing so. on my way there, I'm hoping to create a lot of projects, some of which can be found either on my GitHub or in the sections below.</p>
                    <p>I also am working on honing my skills with pixel art, especially for use later in game design. Keep an eye on my gallery to see what I've been working on recently.</p>

                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>When I got to college, the first thing I was told to do was install the app GroupMe. It would serve as a communication hub for me and my peers throught my four years there. However, I noticed that in comparison to other group chat apps, such as Discord, there was a notable lack of features I had grown to consider standard. In particular, I noticed that the process to automate certain processes was particularly hard to work out.</p>
                <p>I hoped to resolve this issue by poring over the API documentation provided at <a href="https://dev.groupme.com/">dev.groupme.com</a>. However, perhaps due to GroupMe's recent (at the time) acquisition by Microsoft, I found it particularly hard to read, but eventually was able to work my way to a fully functioning bot that interacted with other APIs to provide a good deal of functionality to our various group chats.</p>
                <p>This, however, was written as a one-off application, and could not be published due to an insecure inclusion of API keys and secrets in my server. So, I decided to start from scratch and build a framework that would be able to read easy-to-write .JSON files containing data about responses and timed messages to send to groupme. Thus arose my GroupMe Bot Framework, which I hope will make production of GroupMe bots substantially easier.</p>

                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>Sidekick will be a game where the player takes on the role of a supporting character in a typical RPG. While the character helps out various heroes, he still remains a sidekick, never taking the center stage in the adventures he assists on. However, this game hopes to highlight the importance of people helping heroes, in addition to providing a glimpse into the lessons learned by and internal struggles of a serving spirit.</p>

When he is annoyed, frustrated, or fed up with them, he is just as powerless as the people he wants to protect. Join Emp in a struggle to remain loving in a world which drives him crazy, and through doing so, save it.</p>
